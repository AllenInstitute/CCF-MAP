# Common Coordinate Framework and Multi-Species Atlas Primer

The Human and Mammalian Brain Atlas (HMBA) consortium has developed a standardized set of mouse, marmoset, macaque, and human atlases. Each atlas is composed of a 3D template, a template space, regional segmentations of that template, and a set of taxonomic terms used to name the segmentations. Together, these define a common coordinate framework that can be used as a 3D reference for mapping volumetric and spatial data. This repository contains examples for using the template for downstream applications. 

CCF data assets is hosted on a public S3 bucket on Amazon Web Services (AWS) **here**.
