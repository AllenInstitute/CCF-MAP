## CCFv3 ontology

The CCFv3 ontology (Wang et al. 2020) describes structures spanning 43 isocortical areas and their layers, 314 subcortical gray matter structures, 81 fiber tracts, and 8 ventricular structures. Gray matter is sub-divided into 3 large regions (“cerebrum,” “brain stem,” and “cerebellum”), which are themselves organized into subregions with differing numbers of “leaves” in the hierarchical tree. 

The 2020 version (1) adds new annotations for layers of the Ammon’s horn (CA), main olfactory bulb (MOB) and minor modification of surrounding fiber tracts and (2) sets the atlas origin at the anterior commissure to align with HMBA atlases.
