## HOMBA ontology

The Harmonized Ontology of Mammalian Brain Anatomy (HOMBA) is a harmonized cross-species taxonomy of 2341 brain and spinal cord structures. Derived from the Allen Developing Human Brain Atlas (DHBA) ontology, the HOMBA is hierarchical, allowing users to aggregate structures from fine grain parcellations to broad regions. Terminology is harmonized across human, primate, and rodent structures with synonymous terms and includes transient developmental structures. HOMBA is designed for neuroanatomical applications including brain sampling and dissection, tissue block mapping, atlas building, cell-type and pathology localization, and linking cross-species and developmental datasets.
